$A0	number of collision tiles the current level contains
$A2	sprite x position on current level tile (takes into account if the tile is flipped)
$A4	inverse of sprite y position rounded to the nearest 32x32 tile (used in combination with sprite x to generate offset into 32x32 tilemap to find what tile the sprite is standing on)
$A6	sprite x position on current level tile (x & 0x1F)
$A8	current 32x32 tile number that the sprite is on
$AA	pointer to collision tile code
$AC	current collision tile number that the sprite is on (might turn into slope steepness type later on)
$AE	derived from $AC (appears to be the backup once $AC is messed with)
