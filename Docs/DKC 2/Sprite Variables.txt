Terrain interaction flags

High byte is a 1 frame delayed mirror of low byte
Low byte is set first then copied to high next frame

The delayed mirror is used to detect is an event JUST happened, for example if the bit for touching the top of a tile is different between low and high we can tell if the sprite just left/landed on the ground

t	touching top of tile
s	touching side of tile
c	touching bottom of tile/climbing on tile?

p	touching platform sprite that can be stood on

Used as an index into the state table of the sprite's main routine. Some sprites handle this as a 16 bit word while others use $2F,x as state and use this as a single byte sub state of $2F,x with an alternate table

Size: Byte

Sprite sub state

Not always used but when it is it's passed back to sprite main and used in an alternate state table exclusive to the sprites current $2E,x state
